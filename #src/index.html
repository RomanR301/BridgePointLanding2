            <h3>Fair Compensation</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately, compensation from the government body expropriating your property
              rarely reflects fair market value and it does not take into account the costs associated with
              expropriation.
            </p>
            <p class="text-blue">Financing from BridgePoint allows you to access and work with top
              expropriation lawyers and experts to advance your claim and ensures that you receive fair compensation.

            <h3>Expropriation Costs</h3>
            <p>Aside from the compensation paid for the expropriated property, there are additional costs associated
              with expropriation that should be covered. These can include legal and expert fees, relocation costs, and
              for businesses, the interruption and/or delay of operations.

            <p class="text-blue">As an advance on your claim, BridgePoint provides funding to cover these costs until

            <p>The impact of expropriation can include cashflow issues related to the disruption of business operations,
              a loss of goodwill, and maintaining a stable environment for employees, customers and suppliers.

                <p>There are nuances in every province; however market value is generally defined as market value the
                  amount that the land might be expected to realize if sold in the open market by a willing seller to a
                  willing buyer. Compensation is generally assessed based on the market value, or the value to the
                  owner, in addition to any losses caused by the owner of the land due to disturbance. Our expropriation
                  financing product helps further claims ensuring that clients are compensated for fair market value and

                <p>Injurious affection is an effect of expropriation essentially meaning when the property is “hurtfully

                  This often occurs when land is taken for roads, pipelines or railways. In these types of situations,
                  the owner can claim for compensation for the expropriated lands as well as the devaluation of the
                  remaining land.</p>
